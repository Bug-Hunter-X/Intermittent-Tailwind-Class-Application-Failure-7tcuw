# Intermittent Tailwind Class Application Failure

This repository demonstrates a bug where Tailwind CSS classes are intermittently not applied, even with purging enabled.  The issue appears to be related to dynamic content updates.

## Bug Description

The problem occurs when using Tailwind classes within dynamically updated components. Some classes work correctly, but others fail to apply consistently. The inconsistency makes debugging very challenging.

## Reproduction Steps

1. Clone the repository.
2. Run `npm install`.
3. Run `npm run dev`.
4. Hover over the div element. You'll notice that the hover effect may or may not apply consistently. 

## Solution

The solution involves ensuring that the component is fully re-rendered after the updates.  This can be achieved using techniques like forcing re-renders with `key` props or using libraries that facilitate efficient dynamic updates. The solution file provides a corrected implementation.
